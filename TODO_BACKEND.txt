When I implement VarDefinition and Assignment:
  Use the func_table to rename func calls cus they aren't done properly rn
  Though I will implement lower_rvalue right now (even if its not being used)

Note:
PairElem on RValue doesn't have a type so I have to either:
a) Add types to enumPairElem
b) Add a type to RValue::PairElem (similar to how LValue has it)
c) Deal with it on caller side and wrangle multiple times
